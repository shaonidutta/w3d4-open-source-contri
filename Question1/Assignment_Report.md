## üêõ Issue Identification & Analysis

### **Issue Addressed: Dark Mode Persistence Bug**

**Problem Description:**
The dark mode setting in ShopNex resets to light mode after page reload or refresh, disrupting user experience.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Navigate to the ShopNex website
2. Enable dark mode using the theme toggle
3. Refresh the page or reload the website
4. Observe that dark mode setting reverts to light mode

**Expected Behavior:**
Dark mode setting should persist across page reloads and refreshes, maintaining user preference.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
Using AI tools to analyze the codebase, I identified that:
- Theme state was managed in React Context but not persisted
- No localStorage implementation for theme preference
- State initialization always defaulted to "dark" regardless of user preference

**Technical Investigation:**
```javascript
// Original problematic code in ShopContext.jsx
const [theme, setTheme] = useState("dark"); // Always defaults to "dark"

// No persistence mechanism found
```

## üõ†Ô∏è AI-Assisted Development Process

### **Using AI Tools for Codebase Understanding:**

1. **Code Analysis**: AI helped analyze the entire codebase structure and identify the Context API pattern
2. **Problem Identification**: AI assisted in tracing the theme management flow and identifying the persistence gap
3. **Solution Design**: AI suggested localStorage implementation patterns and React best practices
4. **Code Generation**: AI helped write clean, maintainable code that matches project conventions

### **AI Workflow:**
- **@codebase referencing**: Used to understand component relationships
- **Repo-wide chat**: Analyzed state management patterns across the application
- **Code suggestions**: Generated localStorage persistence logic
- **Best practices**: Ensured code quality and React conventions

## üîß Solution Implementation

### **Fix Applied: localStorage Persistence**

**Technical Changes:**

1. **Added useEffect import:**
```javascript
import React, { createContext, useState, useEffect } from "react";
```

2. **Enhanced theme initialization:**
```javascript
const [theme, setTheme] = useState(() => {
  // Initialize theme from localStorage or default to "dark"
  const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem('shopnex-theme');
  return savedTheme || "dark";
});
```

3. **Added persistence hooks:**
```javascript
// useEffect hooks for localStorage persistence
useEffect(() => {
  localStorage.setItem('shopnex-theme', theme);
}, [theme]);

useEffect(() => {
  localStorage.setItem('shopnex-wishlist', JSON.stringify(wishlistItems));
}, [wishlistItems]);
```

4. **Enhanced wishlist persistence (bonus fix):**
```javascript
const [wishlistItems, setWishlistItems] = useState(() => {
  // Initialize wishlist from localStorage
  const savedWishlist = localStorage.getItem('shopnex-wishlist');
  return savedWishlist ? JSON.parse(savedWishlist) : [];
});
```

### **Focus: Bug Fix Only**

This contribution focuses specifically on resolving the dark mode persistence bug. The implementation is clean, minimal, and addresses only the core issue without introducing unnecessary complexity.
